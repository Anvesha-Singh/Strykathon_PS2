# Surgical Smoke Detection
.ipynb file contains different models developed for the prediction along with pre-processing.
## Background
Laparoscopic surgery commonly known as Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), in which operations
are performed through small incisions elsewhere in the body rather than through large incisions as
with traditional open surgery. During this surgical process, a laparoscope (highresolution camera)
and a light source are inserted through one of the small incisions. This allows the surgeons to view
the inside of the body on a monitor.
One of the many challenges that surgeons face during laparoscopic surgery is heavy smoke
development (caused due to cauterization) that reduces the visibility of the surgery on the monitor.
Therefore, there is a necessity in accurate and reliable recognition of smoke that can trigger
automated smoke evacuation systems. We are looking to develop a deep learning model to detect
smoke and non-smoke frames during surgical process.
## Task Overview
Develop a deep learning model to classify given sample (set of frames) as SMOKE (label=1) or
NON-SMOKE (label=0). The Model can be any deep learning-based Architecture. (custom CNN
model is allowed).
Note: The prediction should be based on samples, not individual frames.
